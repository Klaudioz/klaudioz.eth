Quick answer: **Yes**, high availability is not about being a hundred percent available. It's about being close to that. Actually, the word is **high** availability. It's not total availability or full availability.

A hundred percent uptime with no failures and with no humans involved is an utopia, and not just that. Itâ€™s also a wrong goal because the nature of http prevents you from always being a 100% HA (High availability). The chances that not a single request will ever be lost are impossible for a system with an important number of activity.

Itâ€™s not just a technical or money challenge, itâ€™s a human issue, and as humans we will fail. It involves everything and anything can fail any moment. We can plan and implement very reliable architectures, but get a 100% HA is an infinite resources issue. I think we can understand easily this phenomenon with an exponential function graph like:

Iâ€™ve put some invented figures which are giving a good idea about what youâ€™ll see in the graph. Basically, a 100% HA will have an infinite cost. Itâ€™s the nature of exponential numbers. Even having an infinite budget for implementing this extremely complex architecture, itâ€™s needed also a 100% HA of your internet, electric sources and another invisible system for a common user like [Cloudflare](https://blog.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-outage-on-july-17-2020/), cloud availability zones or regions, etc.

Seeing the graph, my recommendation is to find the **inflection point** between the costs and availability. We can calculate it with the **second derivative** of the graph.

Another important question is: Maybe right now is impossible to get 100% HA but what about in the future?. Itâ€™s very to predict anything, specially in this industry where the knowledge is changing so fast. The only constant is the change and complexity going up so, in my opinion, itâ€™ll be very difficult for me to see this utopia as a reality, during my lifetime ðŸ˜¬

This post is based in the last episode of [DevOps Paradox](https://www.devopsparadox.com/episodes/high-availability-does-not-mean-100-availability-70/) podcast which I can highly recommend you.
