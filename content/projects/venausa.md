This is my first experience as a solopreneur. I've worked very hard in this project about 3 months.

I've to do everything by my own including:

- Record the videos.
- Managing social network content: Twitter, Facebook and my bet niche, LinkedIn.
- Do webinars.
- Managing a created community in circle.so.
- Set analytics with Plausible
- Set the website using Hugo hosted with Firebase.
- Set Gumroad with Paypal for payment management.

I got some help on:

- Video edition (My wife)
- Graphics creation (Help by [grezan](www.grezan.cl))

I'm very happy with the result, but I'm still waiting to get more students. One of my students is starting the process to go to the US to study a master, so his success can help to leverage the project soon.
