Venausa.net is my first experience as a solopreneur. I've worked very hard on this project for about three months, and I'll keeping this platform for years because it's a long-term project. It's based on my experience of moving to the US and multiplied my salary in one year, changing my life quality by a 100%.

I've to do everything on my own, including:

- Record the videos.
- Managing social network content: Twitter, Facebook, and my best niche, LinkedIn.
- Do webinars.
- Managing a created community in circle.so.
- Set analytics with Plausible.
- Set the website using Hugo hosted with Firebase.
- Set Gumroad with Paypal for payment management.
- Paperwork to create a company.
- Zapier automation after a buy.

I got some help on:

- Video edition with FCP (My wife).
- Room decoration and furniture (My wife).
- Graphics creation (Help by [grezan](www.grezan.cl))

I'm delighted with the results of this project, but I'm still waiting to get more students. One of them is starting to go to the US to study for a master's, so his success can help leverage the project soon.
