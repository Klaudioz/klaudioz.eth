VSCode extension with 3K+ installs.

Working in Progrexion, I needed to convert tons of cron entries to YAML to work with Saltstack. Probably I was able to do it manually, but I prefer to automate it.

There is a chance that I'll need to use it again. Also, I noticed that nothing like that exists on the VSCode marketplace, so I wanted to know about Typescript, and I just created the extension if anybody can be benefited from this.
